# AQUACONTROL
Aquacontrol is a freshwater Aquarium controller to make it easy the interaction with the most common technical equipment used in aquariums.

You can find:
1. PCB Board project on [Circuit Maker](https://workspace.circuitmaker.com/Projects/Details/Pablo-Garcia/Aquacontrol)
1. Housing for 3D Printer on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3843515)

And here on GitHub the repository includes:
- apk. Android apk developed on [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
- Aquacontrol. ESP8266 firmware developed on [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software).
- me. Case developed on [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/).

## Setup
Aquacontrol consists on one PCB which controls the most common technics on the beginners aquarium:
- Heater, to heat the water usually around 25ÂºC.
- Filter, to keep the biological and mechanical filtering of the water running.
- Lamp, to illuminate the aquarium and improve plants growing.
- Aerator, to improve the exchange of O2.

To ease the setup and to avoid cutting the equipment cables, I have used a Simon set:
- Simon 27731-65. Surface mount pack for four sockets.
- Simon 27432-65. 4 Schuko Sockets

## Application
The APK includes a Main Activity to control the Aquarium and a Settings activity con configure MQTT Broker.
